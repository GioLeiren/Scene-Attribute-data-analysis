# Scene-Attribute-data-analysis
Computer Vision is a research area that deals with the development of algorithms to extract information from visual data (images or videos). One of the challenges in this area is the following: given an image, indicate which objects are present in it and indicate important attributes of these objects, such as color and their position in the image. Currently, the most common approach to this problem is based on the use of machine learning techniques (a sub-area of artificial intelligence). To design such algorithms and evaluate your results, there must be a dataset containing images and their respective annotation labels.

One such dataset is the Scene Attribute Dataset, created by researchers at Peking University and the University of
California (Los Angeles). It is a set of thousands of images and some auxiliary files. One of these files contains a text that indicates, for each image file and for each attribute-object pair, what are the coordinates of the rectangle (bounding box) where this object attribute appears in the image.

This project contains a python algorithm which proccesses the textual data from Scene Attribute database, in order to facilitate it's data's analysis.
